+    <para>The only way to backup or to clone a table is to use CopyTable/ExportTable,
+      or to copy all the hfiles in HDFS after disabling the table.
+      The disadvantages of these methods are that you can degrade region server performance
+      (Copy/Export Table) or you need to disable the table, that means no reads or writes;
+      and this is usually unacceptable.
+    </para>
+    <para>HBase Snapshots allow you to take a snapshot of the table without too much impact
+      and cloning/restoring a table without making data copies.
+      Also, Exporting the snapshot to another cluster doesn't have impact on the the region servers.
