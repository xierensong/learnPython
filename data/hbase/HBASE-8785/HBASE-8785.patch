+    <description>ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. It is used in two different ways.
+      First, this value is used in the ZK client that HBase uses to connect to the ensemble.
+      It is also used by HBase when it starts a ZK server and it is passed as the 'maxSessionTimeout'. See
+      http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_zkSessions.
+      For example, if a HBase region server connects to a ZK ensemble that's also managed by HBase, then the
+      session timeout will be the one specified by this configuration. But, a region server that connects
+      to an ensemble managed with a different configuration will be subjected that ensemble's maxSessionTimeout. So,
+      even though HBase might propose using 90 seconds, the ensemble can have a max timeout lower than this and
+      it will take precedence. The current default that ZK ships with is 40 seconds, which is lower than HBase's.
