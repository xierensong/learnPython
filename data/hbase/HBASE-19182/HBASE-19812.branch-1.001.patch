 Prefix Tree::
   Prefix tree encoding was introduced as an experimental feature in HBase 0.96.
   It provides similar memory savings to the Prefix, Diff, and Fast Diff encoder, but provides faster random access at a cost of slower encoding speed.

 Prefix Tree may be appropriate for applications that have high block cache hit ratios. It introduces new 'tree' fields for the row and column.
 The row tree field contains a list of offsets/references corresponding to the cells in that row. This allows for a good deal of compression.
 For more details about Prefix Tree encoding, see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4676[HBASE-4676].
-+
+
 It is difficult to graphically illustrate a prefix tree, so no image is included. See the Wikipedia article for link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie[Trie] for more general information about this data structure.
 
+Prefix Tree will be removed in hbase-2.0.0. It is a sweet feature but has seen little uptake and is not actively maintained.

 === Which Compressor or Data Block Encoder To Use
 
 The compression or codec type to use depends on the characteristics of your data. Choosing the wrong type could cause your data to take more space rather than less, and can have performance implications.
