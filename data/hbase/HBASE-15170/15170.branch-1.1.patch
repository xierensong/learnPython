Subject: [PATCH] HBASE-14807 TestWALLockup is flakey Second attempt at
 stabilizing this test.

Patch includes loosening of the test so we continue when threads
run in not-expected order. Also includes minor clean ups in
FSHLog -- a formatting change, removal of an unused trace logging,
and a check so we don't create a new exception when not needed --
but it also includes a subtle so we check if we need to get to safe
point EVEN IF an outstanding exception. Previous we could by-pass
the safe point check. This should make us even more robust against
lockup (though this is a change that comes of code reading, not of
any issue seen in test).

Here is some detail on how I loosened the test:

The test can run in an unexpected order. Attempts at dictating the
order in which threads fire only had me deadlocking one latch
against another (the test latch vs the WAL zigzag latch) so I
gave up trying and instead, if we happen to go the unusual route of
rolling WALs and failing flush before the scheduled log roll
latch goes into place, just time out the run after a few seconds
and exit the test (but do not fail it); just log a WARN.

This is less than ideal but allows us keep some coverage of the
tricky scenario that was bringing on deadlock (a broken WAL that
is throwing exceptions getting stuck waiting on a sync to clear
out the ring buffer getting overshadowed by a subsequent append
added in by a concurrent flush).
